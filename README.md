#### Live site: [https://mathproblems.dickykitchen.com/]

## Purpose:

- to create a program to help my son practice math on a 3rd/4th grade level over the summer so his skills don't get rusty

## Resources Used:

- Vite
- React
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- feedback from my son's 3rd grade teacher to determine criteria for 3rd/4th grade math problems
- feedback from my son for how math problems are typically structured

## Achievements:

- created a set of 15 random math problems that change on every page load and meet requirements for 3rd/4th grade competencies
- on submitting the answer, the user is provided with confirmation if the answer is correct or not and given the answer if it is incorrect
- set up a set of functions that prevent the creation of math problems that would result in negative answer, improper fractions, or division by zero
